I did this on Ubuntu 22.04 with Docker version 20.10.12.
First you need to install buildx
wget https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/download/v0.4.1/buildx-v0.4.1.linux-amd64
chmod a+x buildx-v0.4.1.linux-amd64
mkdir -p ~/.docker/cli-plugins
mv buildx-v0.4.1.linux-amd64 ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-buildx
Confirm that this first step works, by doing:  docker buildx version
If that stage doesn't work by confiming the version of buildx, then you can't proceed
Once buildx is installed, do:
docker buildx create --name mybuilder --driver docker-container
docker buildx use mybuilder
Then create a small Dockerfile to test your multiplatform build:
vi Dockerfile
copy and paste this into the Dockerfile and save:
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
FROM alpine:3.16
RUN apk add curl
Then login into you dockerhub, if you havn't done so already:
docker login -u <dockerhub_username> -p <dockerhub_password>
Build and push to dockerhub:
docker buildx build . --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64,linux/arm/v7 -t <dockerhub_username>/<your_imagename>:latest --push
Finally, inspect your image and confirm you have at least three platforms:
docker buildx imagetools inspect <dockerhub_username>/<your_imagename>:latest
You should something like that when you run that last command. That's my own Ubuntu screenshot
